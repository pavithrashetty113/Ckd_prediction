    <h1>Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Information</h1>
    <p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition where the kidneys don't work as well as they should. It's a common condition often associated with ageing.</p>
    <h2>
        What is CKD?
    </h2>
    <div>
    <p>
      Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a condition characterized by the gradual loss of kidney function over time. It is a serious medical condition that can lead to complications such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, anemia, and eventually kidney failure if left untreated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kidneys play a crucial role in filtering waste and excess fluids from the blood, regulating electrolyte balance, and producing hormones that regulate blood pressure and red blood cell production. In CKD, the kidneys become damaged and are no longer able to perform these functions effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are various causes of CKD, including diabetes, hypertension, glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the kidney's filtering units), polycystic kidney disease (a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of cysts in the kidneys), and prolonged obstruction of the urinary tract.
    </p>
    <p>
      The progression of CKD is divided into five stages based on the estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), which measures how well the kidneys are filtering waste from the blood. Stage 1 is the mildest form of CKD, with a normal or mildly reduced eGFR, while Stage 5, also known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD), is the most severe, requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation for survival.
    </p>
    <p>
      Symptoms of CKD may not be apparent in the early stages but can include fatigue, swelling in the legs and ankles, changes in urine output, difficulty concentrating, and loss of appetite as the condition progresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regular monitoring of kidney function through blood tests, urine tests, and blood pressure measurements is essential for individuals with CKD to track disease progression and adjust treatment accordingly. In some cases, advanced interventions such as dialysis or kidney transplantation may be necessary to sustain life in end-stage kidney disease.
